		- a closure is a function that captures the variables from its surrounding scope
		- this allows the function to access and modify those variables even after the surrounding scope has finished executing
		- closures are often used to create functions with state, such as counters or accumulators
		- closures can be used to create private variables that are not accessible from outside the function
		- use closures wisely â€” overusing them can make your code harder to read and maintain
